## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/babneek/BookBrain.git
cd BookBrain
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. (Optional, for local Wikisource screenshots) Install Playwright browsers
If you want to use Playwright for Wikisource scraping (with screenshots) **locally**, run:
```bash
playwright install
```

> **Note:** On Streamlit Cloud, Playwright is not used for Wikisource scraping due to browser sandboxing and installation limitations. Instead, the app uses a robust fallback with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for text extraction only (no screenshots). This ensures compatibility and reliability in the cloud environment.

### 5. Configure your LLM API
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Supported APIs:**
- OpenAI API
- OpenRouter API
- Any other compatible LLM API

### 6. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API errors:** Make sure your LLM API key is set in the `.env` file and is valid.
- **Playwright errors (local only):** Run `playwright install` to install required browsers. On Streamlit Cloud, Playwright is not used.
- **ChromaDB issues:** The app stores embeddings in `./chroma_data` by default. Make sure you have write permissions.
- **Q/A or MCQ not working:** Ensure you have selected a chapter and uploaded valid content.
- **Import errors:** Make sure you're running the app from the project root directory.

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Verify your API key is set and working
3. Ensure you're using Python 3.10 or higher
4. Try running `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --logger.level debug` for detailed logs
