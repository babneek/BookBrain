## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/babneek/BookBrain.git
cd BookBrain
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. (No Playwright needed) Wikisource scraping uses requests+BeautifulSoup
Wikisource scraping is now handled using requests and BeautifulSoup only. No browser or Playwright setup is required.

> **Note:** Screenshots of Wikisource pages are no longer supported. The app uses a robust fallback with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for text extraction only. This ensures compatibility and reliability in all environments.

### 5. Configure your LLM API
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Supported APIs:**
- OpenAI API
- OpenRouter API
- Any other compatible LLM API

### 6. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
