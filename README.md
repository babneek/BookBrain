## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API errors:** Make sure your LLM API key is set in the `.env` file and is valid.

- **Q/A or MCQ not working:** Ensure you have selected a chapter and uploaded valid content.
- **Import errors:** Make sure you're running the app from the project root directory.

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Verify your API key is set and working
